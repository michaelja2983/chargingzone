![Mockup Image](/assets/images/website%20mock%20up.JPG)

The Charging Zone App/Site was developed to address the needs to electric vehicle owners. The site is a one stop shop to locate electric chargers nearest to the user. It goes further to educate owners about charger connector types and offers that chance to join a membership club which will offer key information.

## DESIGN

### Design Choices

The site was designed with the user in mind, it has been created to offer a clean focused method of passing information.

### Colors

Colors were chosen to complement the HERO image, warm and inviting blues with contrasting red has been chosen as a striking, bold an inviting space. To find the best complemenry colours I used ADOBE color which once selected were tested on WebAIM to ensure the constrast of colours was best suited together.

![colors](https://github.com/michaelja2983/chargingzone/assets/148334530/fde9bf9b-9fea-4950-9dc1-18a8977289b3)

Adaptions were made to the color scheme as a result of the results from the ==accessiblity validator==. This involved experimenting to ensure contrast was appropraite for those that may suffer from visual conditions. 

### Font

Open Sans from Google Font's was chosen for its clear easy and professional appeal.

The website is designed to be appealing and easy to navigate. In the header is an easy to use navigation bar, which directly below a HERO image of an vehicle with shown with a text info overlay. The page then flows with an objective and aims section quickly setting out what the site is about. Next the page flows into an info section on electric charger connectors before concluding with a Footer section with social media links. The website consists of three pages;

- A home page with aims and objectives and electric connector information.
